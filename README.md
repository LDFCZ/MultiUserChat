Multi User Server-Client chat

This project is still in development. In the client part I use the Spring boot framework. I'm trying to deal with dependency injection and I think I'm on the right track. At the moment, only the implementation of sending and receiving messages needs to be completed in the client. The server part uses Hibernate to work with databases. The server and the client communicate with each other by means of a TCP socket. The server is currently at the stage of database implementation.
